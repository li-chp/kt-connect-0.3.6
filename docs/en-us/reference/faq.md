#### Q: I have several kubernetes clusters, how to specify the target of `ktctl` ?

A: `ktctl` will access cluster according to local configuration of `kubectl` tool, which usually lay on `~/.kube/config`.

#### Q: Encounter error of "too many open files" under MacOS/Linux ?

A: This is caused by the insufficient upper limit of the number of system file handles. For solutions, please refer to: [MacOS](https://www.jianshu.com/p/d6f7d1557f20) / [Linux](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75897823)

#### Q: After executing `exchange` or `mesh` command, a 503 error is reported when accessing the target Service, and the returned Header contains "server: envoy" ?

A: The default `selector` mode of Exchange and the default `auto` mode of Mesh are not compatible with the Istio service mesh. If Istio components are used, please use the `scale` mode of Exchange and the `manual` mode of Mesh.
If the above error still exists after the switch, please check why the `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule` rules on the service cannot select the Shadow Pod created by KT.

#### Q: Encounter error of "unable to do port forwarding: socat not found" or "ssh: handshake failed: EOF" when executing `ktctl` command ?

A: The port mapping function of `Ktctl` depends on the `socat` tool on the cluster host, please pre-install it on each node of the cluster (Debian/Ubuntu distribution installation command: `apt-get install socat`, CentOS/RedHat distribution installation command: `yum install socat`)

#### Q: After running `ktctl connect`, still got "could not resolve host" issue when accessing service domain name in cluster ?

A: Rerun the `ktctl connect` command with `--debug` parameter, and observe whether there is a related domain name checking log output on the `ktctl` console when accessing it.
If there is an error of "domain <domain-name-you-are-visiting> not exists", please check whether the cluster you are connected to and the service domain name you are visiting is correct (you can verify it by accessing the domain name from a pod in the cluster);
If no relevant output is printed, it means that the system DNS configuration is not setting to the DNS server of kt correctly. Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues) with your local operating system version and the ktctl version information, we'll look into it further.
